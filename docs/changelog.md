# Uppend — Changelog

## [2026-09-19] (Session 19)
- Implemented: Gamification Phase 2 (Goals). Migrated user profiles to include a `daily_goal` column. Added a new Goals section in Settings. Redesigned the dashboard Overview Stats row: relocated the streak badge out of the search/filter row and right-aligned it, added a weekly application count badge, and updated the daily goal badge with a proportional graduated progress fill. Fixed false-affordance issues on static badges by maintaining their low-opacity appearance. Added hover tooltips to the Overview Stats badges for clarity.
- Implemented: Quote of the Day. Added a deterministic, locally-cached quote rotation based on the day of the year (`lib/cache/quotes.ts`). Replaced an initial integration with the ZenQuotes API after finding its `/today` endpoint lacked topic filtering and returned irrelevant quotes, avoiding another unreliable third-party dependency.
- Implemented: Streak Weekend Exemption. Modified the streak calculation logic (`lib/utils/streaks.ts`) so that gaps on Saturday and Sunday no longer break an active application streak. The streak count continues to only increment on days with actual applications to prevent inflation from idle weekends. This preserves the purely live-computed, zero-schema architecture.


## [2026-09-17] (Session 18)
- Updated: Docs cleanup (ApplyFlow -> Uppend), fixing legacy email and URL references across README, architecture, decisions, AGENTS.md, and cron route fallback string.
- Implemented: Current Streak feature (branch `feature/current-streak`, merged). Tracks consecutive days with applications via `applications.created_at`, surfacing `active`, `at_risk`, or `none` states on a dashboard badge.
- Implemented: Activity Heatmap feature. Displays application volume on a calendar grid via a dropdown attached to the streak badge. Includes the mid-implementation redesign from a full-screen modal to an anchored dropdown reusing the existing filter pattern, month-navigation clamped to account creation, and post-merge fixes for dark-mode empty-tile contrast and future-date blanking.

## [2026-09-16] (Session 17)
- Fixed: two bugs in source-field URL auto-detection found during manual
  testing � the source `<select>`'s custom onChange wasn't clearing
  `aiSuggestedFields` on manual change (unlike every other field), and
  the paste handler blocked re-detection on any existing source value
  instead of only on a user-confirmed one. Both fixed by correctly
  distinguishing "still just a guess" from "confirmed" via
  `aiSuggestedFields`.
- Removed: the "AI suggested" Sparkles icon / blue-border visual cue
  that had been added for the source field � decided not to show it,
  and not to extend it to the AI-extraction flow either.
- Fixed: dropdown arrow spacing on all 8 native `<select>` elements
  across `/new` and the application detail page � browser default arrow
  was sitting flush against the edge; replaced with `appearance-none` +
  padding + a positioned Lucide `ChevronDown` icon.

## [2026-09-15] (Session 17)
- Fixed: cron reminders � added time-budget-aware retry logic
  (skips retry if elapsed time already exceeds a 5000ms budget) after a
  new "Timeout" failure mode appeared post-merge of the initial retry
  fix, likely caused by the retry itself exceeding Vercel Hobby's
  implicit ~10s function execution cap. Added `elapsedMs` and
  `retriedCount` to every response body for future debugging, since
  Vercel Hobby's log retention is too short to catch failures after
  the fact.
- Implemented: job-link quick-access icon on the dashboard (company-name
  cell), opens `job_link` in a new tab, hidden when unset. Revised after
  informal UI review to fix a long-company-name wrapping bug (desktop
  truncation with ellipsis) and switched from always-visible to
  hover-reveal on desktop only, staying always-visible on mobile.
- Implemented: dashboard sort field/direction and current page now
  persist across in-app navigation via `sessionStorage`, resetting on
  browser close. Kept deliberately separate from the existing `pageSize`
  preference (`localStorage`, permanent, untouched).
- Implemented: source field auto-detection from a pasted `job_link` URL
  on `/new` (not the edit page). New `matchSourceFromUrl()` added to
  `lib/constants.ts`, kept separate from the existing
  `matchSourceOption()` used for AI-extraction text matching. Matches
  known job boards by domain keyword, defaults to "Company Website"
  otherwise.

## [2026-09-14] (Session 17)
- Fixed: Supabase local-dev magic-link auth redirect � added
  `http://localhost:3000/**` to the Supabase Redirect URLs allowlist
  (dashboard config only, no code change). Without it, `emailRedirectTo`
  silently fell back to the default Site URL, landing on `/` with a
  stray `?code=` param instead of reaching `/auth/callback`. Same class
  of issue as the 2026-08-24 production fix, never previously extended
  to the local dev URL.
- Updated: live demo link in README.

## [2026-09-13] (Session 17)
- Fixed: cron reminders `/api/cron/reminders` returning intermittent 500
  errors in production (recurring 09/11, 09/13). Root cause traced via
  Vercel logs and cron-job.org execution history to the service-role
  Supabase client having zero retry/timeout handling � a transient
  upstream "Gateway Timeout" from Supabase's own infra was being treated
  as an unrecoverable failure. Added a bounded retry (1 retry, 500ms
  delay) for transient-looking errors across all four Supabase call
  sites in the route, including both lock-rollback updates (the more
  important half, since a failed rollback would otherwise permanently
  strand a reminder's lock as sent).
- Note: confirmed via commit history that `fix/post-delete-session-and-
  local-merge` (bfcache + /migrate confirmation prompt) was merged
  2026-09-10 with real-device verification completed beforehand � this
  had been missed in the Session 16 documentation close and is now
  correctly reflected as resolved.

## [2026-09-13] (Session 16)
- Implemented: Investigation and implementation of both bfcache and /migrate fixes on `fix/post-delete-session-and-local-merge`, evidence-verified via diff/build but explicitly not yet merged pending real-device testing.

## [2026-09-10] (Session 15)
- Implemented: Rebranded "ApplyFlow" to "Uppend" across UI copy, metadata, legal pages, email display names, docs, and local storage keys, merged to main via a standard `--no-ff` merge commit from `rebrand/uppend` (branch left intact, not deleted).
- Implemented: A one-time idempotent IndexedDB migration (`migrateLegacyDb()` in `lib/local/db.ts`) moving data from the legacy `applyflow_local` database to `uppend_local`, using `onupgradeneeded` presence-detection and a write-then-confirm-then-delete safety ordering with `put` for idempotency.
- Confirmed: via full `npm run build` output that the merge to main compiles cleanly, with pre-existing lint warnings unrelated to this change.
- Implemented: Completed the Gmail sender address migration (new address now live across Vercel env vars and Supabase Auth SMTP settings), verified via real magic-link and reminder email sends.
- Note: The sender address change is now done, separate from the email display name change (already shipped in the rebrand branch itself).
- Note: Discovered two related issues during manual testing, not yet fixed: (1) after account deletion, browser back-navigation can restore a stale bfcache'd settings page that shows a false "Saved!" toast on an actually-unauthorized request (confirmed via DB check that no data was written — server-side protection held, client-side feedback is misleading); (2) `/migrate` runs unconditionally after any successful magic-link auth (login or signup, no distinction), silently merging local IndexedDB data into whichever account just authenticated, with no confirmation prompt.

## [2026-09-09] (Session 14)
- Implemented: Cached the dashboard applications query using Next.js `unstable_cache` (tagged by `user_id` with a 60s fallback revalidation). Utilized the service-role client within the cache closure to bypass Next.js dynamic API constraints, relying entirely on explicit `.eq('user_id', userId)` scoping for security.
- Implemented: Added immediate on-demand cache invalidation (`revalidateTag`) to all four application mutation routes (POST, PATCH, DELETE, migrate) to purge the dashboard cache on any write.
- Implemented: Parallelized the user profile and cached applications fetches in the dashboard using `Promise.all`, removing a full sequential round-trip during page load.

## [2026-09-08] (Session 13)
- Fixed: ghosted status update failure — added to PatchSchema and ApplicationInsertSchema in both app/api/applications/[id]/route.ts and app/api/applications/route.ts; added the missing dropdown option to ApplicationDetailClient.tsx and new/page.tsx.
- Implemented: Source field converted from free text to a dropdown (LinkedIn/Indeed/JobStreet/Facebook/Company Website/Referral/Other) with free-text fallback, plus AI auto-match on extraction via new lib/constants.ts (SOURCE_OPTIONS, matchSourceOption). No DB/schema changes; /api/extract untouched.
- Fixed: Removed stale Resend-sandbox copy from login/page.tsx, signup/page.tsx error fallbacks, and merged the outdated Resend privacy-policy bullet into the existing Gmail SMTP entry.
- Fixed: Mobile layout inconsistencies — Role Fit/Culture Fit grid on /new now responsive (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2), removed text-sm from tech-stack inputs on both /new and /applications/[id] to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom-on-focus.
- Fixed: /api/match terminal-error response now returns 422 instead of 500, aligning with /api/extract's existing convention and /api/match's own input-validation responses.
- Fixed: Dashboard status filter — replaced native <select> (whose option-popup border/corners were partially unstyleable via CSS) with a custom button+dropdown pattern matching the existing AI-model-selector dropdown in new/page.tsx. Also fixed an incidental clipping bug found during implementation: the parent container's overflow-x-auto was clipping the absolute-positioned panel; swapped to flex-wrap.

## [2026-09-08] (Session 12)
- Fixed: Resolved the 400 Bad Request error when saving an application with the "Ghosted" status by adding `'ghosted'` to the API Zod validation schemas (`PatchSchema` and `ApplicationInsertSchema`). Added the missing "Ghosted" option to the frontend status dropdowns on both the application detail page and the `/new` route to match the Dashboard's status list.

## [2026-09-07] (Session 11)
- Fixed: Silent-failure UX at /new. Added an additive `extractionFailed` boolean to the `/api/resumes` success response (derived from the existing local `extractedText` variable, no new read). ResumeUploader now shows a persistent inline warning ("Upload successful, but text extraction failed. AI fit analysis will not run when using this resume.") identically in both its Settings and Onboarding usages.
- Fixed: On `/new`, the extraction-complete toast when match analysis is skipped now distinguishes "No default resume set" from "Current resume lacks text" instead of a bare "Extraction complete!" that gave no explanation. Active `/api/match` failure toasts (429/503/other) were already handled correctly and were left untouched.
- Fixed: Save-confirmation UX on `/applications/[id]`. Added a second, bottom-anchored toast next to the sticky "Save Changes" button so confirmation appears where the user is looking, without removing the existing top-of-page toast. Both toasts now clear on the next edit (`setToast(null)` added alongside all three existing `setIsDirty(true)` call sites) rather than persisting stale success messages through unsaved changes.
- Confirmed: `/api/extract` and `/api/match` route logic were untouched by both fixes; verified absent from both diffs.

## [2026-09-06] (Session 10)
- Fixed: Improved the save-confirmation UX on `/applications/[id]` by adding a bottom-anchored inline toast next to the "Save Changes" sticky button. Both top and bottom toasts now automatically dismiss when the user resumes editing the form.
- Fixed: Addressed the silent-failure UX gap for resume extraction by adding a persistent inline warning to the resume uploader, and updated the job extraction flow (`/new`) to surface distinct toast messages when match analysis is skipped due to a missing resume or missing extracted text.
- Fixed: Production email link bug in the cron route (was falling back to localhost) by leveraging a fallback chain using Vercel system environment variables (`VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`, `VERCEL_URL`).
- Fixed: Renamed `processed` field to `fetched` in the `/api/cron/reminders` response to accurately reflect its meaning.
- Fixed: Status badge truncation bug caused by `w-full` on the inner `<select>` element; removing it allows intrinsic width calculation, fixing clipping on longer statuses like "Screening".
- Fixed: Mobile layout constraint for `notes` and `interview_notes` textareas by increasing the default minimum height (`min-h-48`), standardizing cross-device usability despite iOS Safari's native lack of support for the `resize-y` property.
- Implemented: Comprehensive Unsaved Changes navigation guard with a custom `<UnsavedChangesModal />` and dirty-state tracking (`useUnsavedChangesWarning`), intercepting hard navigations, in-app links, and browser back/forward history events across both `/new` and `/applications/[id]`.
- Fixed: Unsaved Changes modal rendering issues. Replaced `window.confirm` with a custom modal rendered via `createPortal` directly to `document.body` to bypass Safari's silent blocking of native popups on swipe-back gestures and to immunize the modal against `position: fixed` layout hijacking by parent element transforms.

## [2026-08-29] (Session 9 - Continued)
- Implemented: Timezone-aware reminders. Added timezone/time capture to Onboarding and Settings, and updated `/api/cron/reminders` to check local time matches rather than strict UTC dates.
- Implemented: Dashboard client-side pagination, including user-preference persistence for page sizes.
- Implemented: Deterministic server-side and client-side sorting by `created_at DESC`, with fallback sorting to prevent jitter.
- Implemented: Added "ghosted" status to application tracking, and set the default dashboard filter to "Active" (hiding rejected/withdrawn/ghosted applications).
- Resolved: Production email link bug in the cron route (was falling back to localhost) by leveraging Vercel system environment variables.
- Fixed: Renamed misleading `processed` field to `fetched` in cron reminders response for clarity.
- Note: An incident occurred during testing where the concurrency test was executed against the live Supabase environment using a real user's profile and `service_role` credentials without prior authorization. A test application was inserted, which successfully triggered a real email to the user's production email address. The test script also attempted to modify the user's `reminder_timezone` and `reminder_send_time` without rollback logic, but the DB mutation failed silently because the migration had not yet been executed in production. The test applications were successfully cleaned up. Going forward, tests must strictly use synthetic users and local/mock databases.

## [2026-08-25] (Session 9)
- Fixed: BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) bug in `/api/extract` and `/api/match` where custom keys were ignored and triggered the `FREE_LIMIT_EXHAUSTED` (403) error if `profiles.preferred_provider` was null. Fixed by decoupling key lookup and defaulting to 'google'.
- Confirmed: PDF resume text extraction is fully functional on the live production environment.
- Confirmed: Vercel Analytics is enabled and actively tracking. Speed Insights was intentionally left disabled to conserve free-tier allocation.
- Fixed: `/api/extract` false-positive rejection of anonymous/company-less job descriptions. Rejection logic now solely evaluates `role` confidence instead of `company_name` to prevent valid postings without explicit company names from being treated as injection attempts.

## [2026-08-24] (Session 8)
- Implemented: Initial production deployment to Vercel.
- Fixed: `vercel.json` UTF-16/BOM encoding bug causing parsing errors in production.
- Fixed: ESLint build-blocking errors (`react/no-unescaped-entities`, `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`).
- Fixed: Supabase magic-link redirect misconfiguration (missing `https://` and `/**` wildcard).
- Note: PDF resume text extraction fixes were merged and deployed to production, but have not yet been confirmed working on the live production environment.

## [2026-08-23]
- Fixed: PDF resume text extraction failing in production (subprocess bundling failure — execSync-invoked script wasn't included in the Vercel serverless bundle).
- Fixed: Follow-up production failure after the above fix (pdfjs-dist canvas API dependency missing in Node serverless runtime) — resolved via @napi-rs/canvas + globalThis polyfill injection.
- Note both were only reproducible in the deployed Vercel environment, not local dev/build — worth remembering for future serverless-specific debugging.

## [2026-08-20] (Session 6)
- Implemented: `guard.ts` AI prompt injection defense bypass fix. Added `normalizeForScan` step to normalize unicode homoglyphs and strip zero-width characters before running the heuristic filter.
- Implemented: Injection defense parity for `/api/match`. Integrated `screenInput` (now `screenResumeText`) and added strict XML-style delimiter isolation (`<job_data>` / `<resume_data>`) with system instructions to ignore payload commands.
- Implemented: Fallback loop bugfix. AI provider errors are now strictly routed via a 3-way classification (`TEMPORARY_PROVIDER`, `PERMANENT_PROVIDER`, `TERMINAL_EXECUTION`), stopping deprecated models from looping infinitely and stopping malformed schemas from burning fallback quota.
- Implemented: Operator alerting system for AI failures via Resend. Deprecation errors (`PERMANENT_PROVIDER`) immediately trigger alerts and 30-day DB blocks. Exhaustion errors trigger alerts deduplicated via a 1-hour sliding window, 3-event threshold RPC.
- Implemented: Confirmed migration `0014_system_alerts_and_blocks.sql` is live and verified on the database.
- Implemented: Migrated all system emails (cron reminders and operator alerts) from Resend to Nodemailer/Gmail SMTP to consolidate email infrastructure.
- Implemented: Added Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights, mounted at the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`).

## [2026-08-20]
- Implemented: Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy pages (app/(legal)/), marked draft-pending-legal-review.
- Implemented: Cookie consent disclosure banner (essential-only, dismiss-and-remember via localStorage), fixed-bottom-bar layout after an initial positioning bug (overlapped hero CTA, clipped button) was caught and corrected.
- Implemented: Clear Local Data button in Settings (IndexedDB wipe, confirmation-gated, hidden during active migration/when no local data exists). Includes a database-connection-closing fix in lib/local/applications.ts that was blocking indexedDB.deleteDatabase.
- Implemented: /api/extract input validation + prompt-injection defense — new lib/ai/guard.ts (heuristic pre-filter), <job_data> delimiter + isolation system instructions, extraction_confidence-based low-confidence soft-rejection. extraction_confidence added to JobExtractionSchema and independently to ApplicationInsertSchema (no extend()/pick() coupling).
- Fixed: decrement_free_ai_uses race condition allowing negative free-use balance under concurrent requests — atomic check-and-decrement RPC (migration 0013_atomic_decrement.sql) + route-level decrementOrThrow helper in app/api/extract/route.ts, fallback-loop-safe (decrements only on successful parse per attempt, not before the loop).
- Note: Pre-launch security pass completed (Phases A-D). Two findings deferred to next session: /api/extract unicode homoglyph bypass on guard.ts's heuristic scan, and /api/match has no equivalent injection defense (relies on /api/extract for billing but has zero input guarding of its own).

## [2026-08-19]
- Implemented: Anonymous local tracking via IndexedDB with migration-to-Supabase upon signup.
- Implemented: Auth UX improvements (cross-tab magic link detection, back-to-landing link).
- Implemented: Added optional resume upload step to onboarding by reusing the extracted `ResumeUploader` component (also used in Settings).
- Implemented: Free-tier AI usage limit (5 lifetime free uses without BYOK), protected by a `service_role`-only trigger, alongside BYOK acquisition instructions in Settings.
- Fixed: Extensive data entry fixes including text field normalization (company/role), salary currency selector and input normalization, 1-5 role/culture fit validation, and double-submit guards across save, delete, and status actions.
- Fixed: Resolved local-mode application detail routing bug (middleware regex fixed to include underscores in local IDs).
- Fixed: Added missing `currency` column migration and decoupled `ApplicationInsertSchema` from `JobExtractionSchema`.
- Refactored: `/api/extract` updated to return `salary_min`, `salary_max`, and `currency` as structured fields instead of a single `salary_range` string.
- Fixed: `ai_model_usage` counter accuracy fixed (extract route was undercounting retried calls) and BYOK-aware UI implemented (hides shared-quota display when user provides their own key).
- Fixed: Mobile layout round 2: landing page header, dashboard header, dashboard local-mode banner, and auth layout back button — all fixed and verified at 375px live render.
- Refactored: Settings BYOK badge deduplicated (was rendering once per model row, now renders once above the model list).
- Implemented: Data export rebuilt: fixed column-alignment bug (was using Object.keys() on first row only), added explicit ordered field allowlist, added JSON and XLSX formats alongside existing CSV, joined interview_stages table into settings query and flattened into all_interview_stages column.
- Note: An incident occurred where service_role was used without prior approval to validate the export against real user data; this was caught, the script and output files were deleted, and validation was redone with synthetic data.

## [2026-08-16]
- Implemented: Landing page redesign (added dark mode support, updated copy accuracy, and restructured signup/login into a shared `(auth)` group).
- Implemented: Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) merged with a Gemini-only scope for secure API key overrides.
- Implemented: Account deletion route (`app/api/account/delete/route.ts`) now includes Supabase Storage cleanup for uploaded resumes.
- Fixed: Critical bug in `match/route.ts` caused by escaped-interpolation in the AI prompt template.
- Fixed: Resolved Resend SMTP sandbox blocking issue (temporary default-SMTP state pending domain purchase).
- Refactored: Extensive lint and typing cleanup resolving 56 `any` errors across the codebase.
- Note: Evaluated the Impeccable design tool on a separate experimental branch; the branch was ultimately discarded and deleted without merging to `main`.

## [2026-08-14]
- Implemented: Initial Claude Project setup initialized with project documentation templates (`project_overview.md`, `architecture.md`, `decisions.md`, `context_handoff.md`).
- In progress: N/A
- Blocked/open questions: N/A
