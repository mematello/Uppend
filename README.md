# Uppend

**Try it live:** [https://mkro-uppend.vercel.app](https://mkro-uppend.vercel.app)

AI-powered job application tracker that turns a pasted job posting into a structured, trackable application — complete with an AI-generated fit assessment against your resume.

Built to solve a real problem from my own job search: manually re-typing job postings into a spreadsheet, then guessing whether a role is actually worth applying to, is tedious and error-prone. Uppend automates both.

## What it does

*   **No signup required** — jump straight into **Local Mode** to try it out. Your data saves securely to your browser (IndexedDB) and can be migrated to the cloud later if you create an account.
*   **Paste a job description** into the app.
    ![New Job Application](./docs/screenshots/new_job_application.png)
*   **AI extraction** — Gemini parses the raw text into structured fields: company, role, tech stack, salary range (with currency selector), location, source, recruiter contact, and notes.
*   **AI fit analysis** — the same job description is compared against your uploaded resume, producing a role fit and culture fit score (1–5), a priority rating (low/medium/high), and a list of matched strengths vs. gaps.
    ![AI Fit Analysis](./docs/screenshots/ai_fit_analysis.png)
*   **Review & save** — both results populate a single form; edit anything before saving.
*   **Track the pipeline** — every saved application moves through statuses (Draft → Applied → Screening → Interview → Offer / Rejected / Withdrawn) on a dashboard you can search and filter.
    ![Dashboard View](./docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)
*   **Optional follow-up reminders** — set a "next action date" on any application, and a scheduled job emails you a reminder ahead of it. Leave it blank if you don't need a nudge.

*   **Data Export** — multi-format export (CSV, JSON, XLSX) available in settings for offline analysis.

## Tech stack

**Frontend**
*   Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19
*   Tailwind CSS v4
*   next-themes (dark/light mode)
*   Lucide React (icons)
*   Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights (mounted in root layout)

**Backend**
*   Next.js API routes (`/api/*`)
*   Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
*   Row Level Security enforced at the database level — every query is scoped to `auth.uid()`

**AI**
*   Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   Multi-model fallback chain (`gemini-3.5-flash` → `gemini-3-flash-preview` → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`) with automatic retry when a model returns a 503 (high demand) or 429 (quota exceeded), so a single provider hiccup doesn't fail the request.
*   Temporary model blocking persisted in Postgres, shared across concurrent requests.

**Document processing**
*   `pdf-parse` and `mammoth` for extracting text from uploaded resumes (PDF/DOCX)

**Notifications & Auth**
*   Auth magic links, scheduled cron reminders (`/api/cron/reminders`), and operator alerts are all delivered permanently via Gmail SMTP (`applyflow.noreply@gmail.com`). 
*   This accepts a ~500/day volume cap and automated sending risks in exchange for zero cost and no custom domain requirements. Resend is no longer used.

## Database schema

| Table | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `profiles` | Per-user settings, including preferred AI model |
| `applications` | Core job application records — extracted fields, AI fit scores, pipeline status |
| `interview_stages` | Timestamped stages/notes tied to a specific application |
| `resumes` | Uploaded resume metadata + extracted text (files live in Supabase Storage) |
| `ai_model_usage` | Tracks daily request counts and temporary blocks per Gemini model |
| `user_api_keys` | Encrypted user-provided API keys for BYOK |
| `system_events` | Stores ephemeral log records for system alerts |
| `system_alerts_state` | State tracker for atomic locking and deduplication suppression of operator alerts |

All tables are protected by Row Level Security — users can only read/write their own data.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mematello/ApplyFlow.git
cd uppend
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
SMTP_EMAIL=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
CRON_SECRET=
BYOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
ALERT_EMAIL=
```

*(Note: `BYOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be a 32-byte hex string used for securely encrypting custom user API keys. You can generate one via: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)*

Set up the database by creating a Supabase project and applying the SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` (via `npx supabase db push` locally, or pasted into the Supabase SQL editor).
*(Note: If running the database strictly locally via Docker instead of the cloud, run `npx supabase start` before pushing migrations).*

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Notable engineering decisions

*   **Resilient AI calls:** rather than letting a single Gemini outage break the extraction flow, the app maintains an ordered fallback list of models, persists temporary blocks to the database (shared across concurrent requests), and returns clean, user-facing error messages instead of raw provider errors.
*   **Parallel AI execution:** extraction and resume matching don't depend on each other, so both requests fire concurrently and resolve to the same model where possible — cutting perceived wait time roughly in half.
*   **Defense-in-depth data scoping:** Row Level Security (RLS) is enforced strictly at the database layer (scoping all access to `auth.uid()`), while server-side API routes explicitly re-scope user queries as a secondary defense layer against accidental cross-tenant data leaks.
*   **Prompt injection defense:** robust input sanitization via `guard.ts` (normalizing unicode homoglyphs and zero-width characters) combined with strict XML-style delimiter isolation for both extraction and matching routes.
*   **AI error classification:** provider errors are strictly routed through a 3-way classification (`TEMPORARY_PROVIDER`, `PERMANENT_PROVIDER`, `TERMINAL_EXECUTION`), solving silent-outage fallback bugs and preventing deprecated models from looping infinitely.
*   **Operator alerting:** an automated system pages operators via Gmail SMTP (deduplicated through a 1-hour sliding window and 3-event threshold RPC) when AI models are deprecated or the fallback chain is exhausted. (Resend was dropped in favor of a shared Nodemailer setup).

## Roadmap

*   [ ] Priority-based sort/filter on the dashboard
*   [ ] Resume versioning tied to specific applications
*   [ ] Analytics view (response rates, interview conversion, common tech stack requests)
*   [ ] Browser extension for one-click capture from job boards
*   [ ] JD URL-fetching (automatically scrape job postings from a URL)
